# HandDrawingSwiftMetal

[Here](https://github.com/eisukekusachi/SimpleApplePencilDrawing) is the simple version.

This is a drawing app using [jSignature](https://willowsystems.github.io/jSignature/#/about/linesmoothing/) as a reference. Depending on the strength of the brushstroke, inflections can be added to the lines as well.

Make sure to choose the run scheme `HandDrawingSwiftMetal` before running or building the project.
